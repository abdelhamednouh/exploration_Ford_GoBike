## Dataset

>Forgotten travel records for 2017, 2018 and 2019 was 3,254,324 trips (until May). There are 16 columns in the dataset until I have washed. Some attributes include length, start time, end time, start station id.



## Summary of Findings

> During the day there were more excursions on working days in contrast to the weekends from 8-9am and 17-18pm. Summary time was presumably due to the heat, the most common season of the year. Furthermore, on Monday to Friday, cycling trips tend to be shorter than on weekends. It suggests that the bike sharing scheme is used very stably and effectively on regular working days, while the casual use on weekends is more versatile.
The majority of passengers are men who did not use cycling share on all journeys. Much of the participants were between 25 and 40 years old, as their age grew, their use of bicycles fell considerably,While it's not a significant difference, men prefer to fly shorter than women, as is seen by both a medium and a shorter IQR. Cyclists who have leased the bikes Monday through Friday are marginally older than those who travel on weekends, leading to the use of the commute from some of the uniquely diverse plots.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> -Trip Duration distribution: Trip Duration is a very wide variety of values in the data bundle. The number of trip values first rises at peaks of 600 seconds from around 8,000 to 12,500 values, then drop below 2000 values.
- From the discovery we can see various use patterns/inhabits between the two riders. The system is extensively used by subscribers during working days i.e. Customers travel on Monday through Friday, particularly on the afternoon, while on weekends. Most trips based on working days for subscriptions around 8-9am and 17-18pm but at late afternoon consumers prefer to use more from Monday to Friday around 17pm.
